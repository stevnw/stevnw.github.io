            <p>Hi, I'm Steven and I am currently a Physics undergraduate in the UK, planning to do my postgraduate study in either Optical Engineering or Meteorology. In my spare time I am learning Japanese (and sometimes Chinese (Mandarin)) and making various programs - some of which are related to my Japanese (and sometimes Chinese) learning. I am mostly a hobbiest and everything I know has been either self-taught or comes from having to use said thing in my degree. I mostly use Ruby for personal projects as I like it a lot. I am also familiar with Python3, HTML & CSS, JavaScript, SQL and tools like Vue.js, Flask, Shoes and Gosu.</p>
